# SAIS Service CCA x LooLa Eco Adventure

Mangrove trees are widely acknowledged to be the best CO2 absorbers because they store CO2 not only in their root system but also in the seabed. Furthermore, mangrove trees are extremely valuable as marine life incubators.

The Service CCA has teamed up with [LooLa Eco Adventure](https://loola.net/) for you to plant and name your very own mangrove tree! You can plant one mangrove tree for $10, and you will even get to name your own tree! The team at LooLa will plant your mangrove for you.

Once you plant a mangrove, you can visit the [website](https://mangrove-sais.vercel.app/) that we have created to receive periodic updates about how the mangroves are doing.

## Website

You can visit the website [here](https://mangrove-sais.vercel.app/); the website is hosted on Vercel, and the code is completely open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cytronicoder/mangrove-sais). The website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). The website is also fully responsive and works on mobile devices.
