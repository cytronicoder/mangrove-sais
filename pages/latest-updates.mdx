# ðŸ‘€ Latest updates from Loola

Hi all,

With many thanks to Prof Henkyâ€™s team, we now have our third set of data for the Stamford mangrove project, two months after planting in June.

After 1 month, we noticed that Bruguera was not doing so well (25% died), while Rhizophora was doing very well (100% survival) despite losing around 30% of its leaves (on average, 2 out of 6) after 1 month, and despite growing quite slowly at 1.2 cm average (compared to 3cm average at the Witteveen+Bos site).

The scientists from UMRAH and Witteveen + Bos figured that the bad performance from Bruguera was to be expected as this species favours higher ground, and the Stamford site is quite deep, just beyond the natural mangrove shoreline. The loss of leaves was also attributed to the fact that the site, being in deeper water, is submerged relatively often.

This monthâ€™s data show that Bruguera, indeed, is not suitable for planting in deeper waters: close to 90% has died, but it will be interesting to see whether the current 12% of survivors will hang in or also succumb next month.

Rhizophora, however, continues with its success story: only 2 of the seedling died, so weâ€™re still at 99% survival rate (spectacular!), and the leaf growth has started to recover: aside from one data point (which is probably a misreading of the data, for mangrove #187 which supposedly went from 6 to 8 and then to 4 leaves), leaf growth has started again with an average leaf growth of 1 new leaf (around 20%) compared to last month.

Growth also seems to be slightly accelerating: whereas last month the growth was only 1.2 cm, this month it was 1.5cm. I love these data, and I look forward to seeing next monthâ€™s data!
