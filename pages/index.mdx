# ðŸŒ´ SAIS Service CCA x LooLa Eco Adventure

Mangroves are widely acknowledged to be the best CO2 absorbers because they store CO2 not only in their root system but also in the seabed. Furthermore, mangroves are extremely valuable as marine life incubators.

The Service CCA has teamed up with [LooLa Eco Adventure](https://loola.net/) for you to plant and name your very own mangrove tree! Additionally, we have created this website for those who have donated to receive periodic updates about how the mangroves are doing.

## Acknowledgments

Many thanks to Marc and the team at LooLa for making the mangrove planting possible! Additionally, we would like to thank Mr. Mckeen - the service coordinator for Stamford - for his guidance and support throughout the project.
